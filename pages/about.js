        Hi, Iâ€™m Kiril Kirilov, a 28-year-old aspiring DevOps Engineer with a passion for automation, cloud technologies, and infrastructure as code.

Currently, I work as a Sales Specialist for Google Maps, where I help businesses leverage location intelligence to enhance their operations. But my true passion lies in DevOpsâ€”building, automating, and optimizing infrastructure for seamless software delivery.

ðŸ’¡ Why DevOps?
Over the years, Iâ€™ve been fascinated by how automation and cloud computing revolutionize modern software development. My goal is to transition into a Junior DevOps role, where I can apply my skills in:
âœ… CI/CD Pipelines â€“ Automating deployments for faster, error-free releases
âœ… Infrastructure as Code (IaC) â€“ Managing scalable infrastructure using Terraform & Ansible
âœ… Cloud Platforms â€“ Gaining hands-on experience with AWS, GCP, and Kubernetes
âœ… Monitoring & Security â€“ Ensuring reliability, performance, and security of cloud environments

ðŸ“– My Learning Journey
Iâ€™ve been actively learning DevOps through courses, hands-on projects, and certifications. My journey includes:
ðŸš€ KodeKloud & Practical Labs for hands-on Kubernetes & Terraform experience
ðŸš€ Building CI/CD Pipelines using GitHub Actions & Docker
ðŸš€ Deploying Personal Projects on Vercel & Cloud Platforms

ðŸŽ¯ Whatâ€™s Next?
Iâ€™m looking for opportunities where I can grow as a Junior DevOps Engineer, contribute to exciting projects, and continue learning in a collaborative environment.

If youâ€™re looking for a motivated, adaptable, and automation-driven professional, letâ€™s connect!
